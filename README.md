 Hate-Speech-DetectionThe objective of this project is to analyze and mitigate hate speech
in online platforms through a comprehensive approach that
encompasses contextual analysis, temporal analysis, user profiling,
geospatial analysis, false positive/negative analysis, and hate
speech detection. By addressing these aspects, the project aims to
enhance our understanding of hate speech dynamics, identify
patterns and trends over time, profile users prone to engaging in
hate speech, analyze geographic distributions, evaluate model
performance, and ultimately develop effective strategies to detect
and miApproach:tigate hate speech online.
